    <!-- Description of Mogging-->
    <h2>
        Mogging is a term used to describe a battle of attractiveness between two people to decide who is the winner "Mogger" and who is the loser "Mogee"<br>
        In our Looksmaxing Society mogging battles have very strict rules so no participants will get harmed during them. <br>
        Outcome of the mogging battle does not have an impact on your rank in the Society but everyday practice can significantly boost your chances of passing the final exam.
